::: {#me}
I am a young scientist with a background in Geology and Earth Sciences.
I specialize in the reconstruction of site formation processes at
archaeological sites through microstratigraphy and complementary
analyses such as grain size and geochemical analyses. My research areas
are Central Asia and Central Europe. Since 2019, I have been conducted
fieldworks in and exploring beautiful countries such as Kyrgyzstan,
Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. As part of my current GACT fellowship at the
University of Tuebingen, I am currently exploring micro-analytical
methods such as micro-FTIR and micro-XRF to support and complement my
micromorphological analyses at *fumier* sites in Central Asia
(Kyrgyzstan). In addition, I recently acquired funding from the NCN
funding scheme for the study of site formation and taphonomic processes
of biogenic sediments at Biśnik Cave—one of the most important
archaeological sites in Poland. I am employing micromorphology,
micro-analytical methods (micro-FTIR, micro-XRF, SEM-EDS) to the study
of sediments, bones, and coprolites.

## Interests
Reconstruction of site formation processes at archaeological sites,
