    "text": "I am a young scientist with a background in Geology and Earth Sciences. I specialize in the reconstruction of site formation processes at archaeological sites through microstratigraphy and complementary analyses such as grain size and geochemical analyses. My research areas are Central Asia and Central Europe. Since 2019, I have been conducted fieldworks in and exploring beautiful countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. As part of my current GACT fellowship at the University of Tuebingen, I am currently exploring micro-analytical methods such as micro-FTIR and micro-XRF to support and complement my micromorphological analyses at fumier sites in Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan). In addition, I recently acquired funding from the NCN funding scheme for the study of site formation and taphonomic processes of biogenic sediments at Biśnik Cave—one of the most important archaeological sites in Poland. I am employing micromorphology, micro-analytical methods (micro-FTIR, micro-XRF, SEM-EDS) to the study of sediments, bones, and coprolites.\n\n\nReconstruction of site formation processes at archaeological sites, microstratigraphy, human and environment interaction, domestication, pastoralism, geoarchaeology, Quaternary geology\n\n\n\n2024 PhD Environmental and Earth Sciences\nPolish Academy of Sciences Institute of Geological Sciences (INGPAN)\nWarsaw, Poland\n2016 MSc Geology\nUniversity of Bologna\nBologna, Italy\n2014 BSc Geological Sciences\nUniversity of Bologna\nBologna, Italy\n\n\n\nI currently am a research assistant at INGPAN and I am leading a project funded by NCN Miniatura 8 on taphonomic prosesses of biogenic deposits in Biśnik Cave (Poland)\nThanks for checking out my web site!"

    "text": "Advanced biomolecular methods are increasingly sought after by archaeologists, and biogenic sediments are prime targets for such analyses. However, taphonomic processes—including diagenesis, erosion, and climate‑related alterations—can modify, relocate, or destroy these deposits compromising their stratigraphic integrity. This, in turn, affects the accurate interpretation of biomolecular data. A microscopic and multi-method approach can aid in developing a well-defined depositional framework. In this project, I apply such an approach to Biśnik Cave (Poland), situated in the Kraków‑Częstochowa Upland. The cave has a thick Quaternary sequence, one of the longest among Polish caves, yet its formation history remains partially understood. Previous efforts have focused on understanding taphonomic processes of biogenic sediments related to Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5), but a comprehensive site formation study encompassing the entire sequence has not yet been conducted. Therefore, this research aims to: a) assess depositional and taphonomic processes of the entire sedimentary sequence of Biśnik Cave, focusing on the integrity of biogenic sediments through a micro‑stratigraphic and multi-method approach; b) improve the identification of biogenic inputs and components, such as bones and coprolites, and understand the potential effects of taphonomic processes on them. My methodology includes the application of micromorphology and micro‑analytical methods such as micro-CT, SEM-EDS, micro-XRF, and micro-FTIR. This research will provide a better understanding of the site formation history and, particularly, the taphonomic processes affecting biogenic sediments in the cave, offering a robust framework for future applications of advanced biomolecular methods.\nThis research activity is funded by NCN Miniatura 8 project number 2024/08/X/ST10/01585"
